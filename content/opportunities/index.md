## **Multiple Ph.D. Positions at Georgia Tech**

Our lab **Computational Design & Metamaterial Lab** warmly invites applications from students with backgrounds in mechanics, aerospace engineering, computer science, materials, polymers, and related fields. Please see my vision for the lab on [home page](/). We are currently on the lookout for **3-4 Ph.D. students** to join our team in the fall of 2024. 

The ideal candidates should possess: 
1. A genuine enthusiasm for science and physics
2. Profound knowledge in their respective academic domains
3. Prior research involvement and achievements
4. Critical thinking and problem-solving skills
5. A collaborative spirit and the ability to work cohesively within a team.

**If you see yourself as a potential fit, please send the following documents to Dr. Bolei Deng (bolei.deng@gatech.edu):**

1. **Resume** (with an emphasis on research experience).
2. Contact information for **1-3 references**.
3. **Transcripts** from undergraduate or graduate studies.

Furthermore, our lab is always open to visiting scholars, research assistants, and exchange students. If interested, please send your resume and your research interests to bolei.deng@gatech.edu.
