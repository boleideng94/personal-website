### **Multiple Open Ph.D. Positions at Georgia Tech**

Our lab **Computational Design & Metamaterial Lab** warmly invites applications from students with backgrounds in mechanics, aerospace engineering, computer science, materials, polymers, and related fields. Please see my vision for the lab on [home page](/). We are currently on the lookout for **3-4 Ph.D. students** to join our team in the fall of 2024. 

The ideal candidates should possess: 
1. A genuine enthusiasm for science and physics
2. Profound knowledge in their respective academic domains
3. Prior research involvement and achievements
4. Critical thinking and problem-solving skills
5. A collaborative spirit and the ability to work cohesively within a team.

**If you see yourself as a potential fit, please send the following documents to Dr. Bolei Deng (bolei.deng@gatech.edu):**

1. **Resume** (with an emphasis on research experience).
2. Contact information for **1-3 references**.
3. **Transcripts** from undergraduate or graduate studies.

**Where to apply?** <br/>
Applicants can apply for the doctoral program in the School of Aerospace Engineering or opt for the Robotics direction within the AE Interdisciplinary Doctoral Degrees. In principle, you can also apply through other engineering disciplines at Georgia Tech (for instance, Mechanical Engineering or Materials Science). If you have such intentions, please specify in the application email. We need to figure out a potential co-advisor from these departments. Furthermore, our lab is always open to visiting scholars, research assistants, and exchange students. If interested, please send your resume and your research interests to bolei.deng@gatech.edu.
