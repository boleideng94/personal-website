### What are metamaterials?
**Metamaterials** are a class of structural materials with exotic properties, where their macroscopic physical characteristics arise from the <u>precise geometric design of their microstructures</u>.

### My role in this
My lab will leverage *artificial intelligence* and *machine learning* for multi-scale design and optimization of metamaterial meso-structures.

We will primarily focus on their **nonlinear mechanical properties**, including *nonlinear dynamics*, *multi-stability*, and *fracture*. Additionally, we will explore how to leverage these characteristics to develop *ultra-strong/tough while lightwseight metamaterials*, design *robot systems* based on metamaterials, and even develop materials with **physical intelligence** capable of *memory*, *computation*, and *decision-making*.

### About Physical Intelligence
**What is Physical Intelligence?**<br/>
Over billions of years, to survive in unstructured real-world environments, biological organisms have developed not only neural intelligence in their brains, but also [<span style="color:LimeGreen">**<ins>Physical Intelligence</ins>**<span>](../../publication/PI_Sitti.pdf) encoded in their body. <span style="color:darkgray"> *For example, Venus flytraps can sense their prey with sensory hairs, process signals and make decisions using chemical reactions, and capture the prey via snap-through instabilities without requiring central neural systems.*<span>

Although recent developments of **computational intelligence** (e.g., artificial intelligence, high performance processors) have matched or even surpassed their biological counterpart neural intelligence, research in **physical intelligence** is still in its infancy. 

**My approach to Physical Intelligence**<br/>
I will combine my expertise in <span style="color:deepskyblue">**Metamaterials**</span> ([<span style="color:deepskyblue"><ins>nonlinear waves</ins>](../projects/project/nonlinear-waves/), [<span style="color:deepskyblue"><ins>phase transitions</ins><span>](../projects/project/phase-transitions/), [<span style="color:deepskyblue"><ins>soft robotics</ins><span>](../projects/project/soft-robots/)), [<span style="color:salmon">**<ins>Responsive Materials</ins>**<span>](../projects/project/micro-structures/), and [<span style="color:orange">**<ins>Design Algorithms</ins>**</span>](../projects/project/inverse-design/) to develop next-geneartion materials, device, and robots with Physical Intelligence.

**A road map**<br/>
The following is a preliminary roadmap for the development of physical intelligence. Thrust 1 and 2 aim to unveil the fundamental relationships between materials, structures, and functionalities, and to build programmable metamaterials that can intelligently interact with environments. Building upon these foundations, Thrust 3 focuses on the creation of systems that exhibit sophisticated physical intelligence.
