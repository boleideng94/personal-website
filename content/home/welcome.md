**My goal is to develop next-geneartion materials, device, and robots with [<span style="color:Teal">**Physical Intelligence**<span>](../../publication/PI_Sitti.pdf) by combining my expertise in [<span style="color:deepskyblue">**Architected Materials**<span> (nonlinear waves](../project/nonlinear-waves/), [<span style="color:deepskyblue">phase transitions<span>](../project/phase-transitions/), [<span style="color:deepskyblue">soft robotics<span>](../project/soft-robots/)), [<span style="color:salmon">**Responsive Materials**<span>](../project/micro-structures/), and [<span style="color:orange">**Design Algorithms**<span>](../project/inverse-design/).**

I received my Ph.D. from Harvard University in 2021, under the guidance of [Prof. Katia Bertoldi](https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Prof. Joanna Aizenberg](https://aizenberglab.seas.harvard.edu/). Currently, I am a postdoc at MIT co-advised by [Prof. Wojciech Matusi](https://cdfg.mit.edu/) at [<span style="color:mediumslateblue">CSAIL<span>](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) and [Prof. Xuanhe Zhao](http://zhao.mit.edu/) at [<span style="color:mediumslateblue">MechE<span>](https://meche.mit.edu/).
