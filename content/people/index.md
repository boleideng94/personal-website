## **Dr. Bolei Deng**
![](about_bolei_deng.png)

Dr. Bolei Deng will join the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology as an Assistant Professor in December 2023 ([<ins>Georgia Tech AE Directory<ins>](https://ae.gatech.edu/directory/person/bolei-deng)). He earned his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Harvard University in 2021 under the guidance of [<ins>Professor Katia Bertoldi<ins>](https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/) (Disseratation: [<span style="color:CornflowerBlue">Flexible Mechanical Metamaterials: Solitary Waves and Phase Transitions<span>](Deng_dissertation2021.pdf)). From early 2022 until now, he has been conducting postdoctoral research at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) with [<ins>Professor Wojciech Matusik<ins>](https://cdfg.mit.edu/) and at the department of Mechanical Engineering with [<ins>Professor Xuanhe Zhao<ins>](http://zhao.mit.edu/). His research during this period include the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in material structure design, metamaterials based robotics, fracture theory in polymer systems, wearable devices, and medical health. He has published 30 academic papers in top international journals, including *Nature*, *PNAS*, *Physical Review Letters*, *Advanced Materials*, *Nature Communications*, and *Science Advances*, with 17 of them as the first or co-first author. Additionally, two of his research contributions have been accepted by top computer science conferences, *ICML* and *Siggraph*.
