abstract: Nonlinear acoustic metamaterials offer the potential to enhance wave control
  opportunities beyond those already demonstrated via dispersion engineering in linear
  metamaterials. Managing the nonlinearities of a dynamic elastic system, however,
  remains a challenge, and the need now exists for new strategies to model and design
  these wave nonlinearities. Inspired by recent research on soft architected rotating-square
  structures, we propose herein a design for a nonlinear elastic metasurface with
  the capability to achieve nonlinear acoustic wave reflection control. The designed
  metasurface is composed of a single layer of rotating squares connected to thin
  and highly deformable ligaments placed between a rigid plate and a wall. It is shown
  that during the process of reflection at normal incidence, most of the incoming
  fundamental wave energy can be converted into the second harmonic wave. A conversion
  coefficient of approximately 0.8 towards the second harmonic is derived with a reflection
  coefficient of <0.05 at the incoming fundamental frequency. The theoretical results
  obtained using the harmonic balance method for a monochromatic pump source are confirmed
  by time-domain simulations for wave packets. The reported design of a nonlinear
  acoustic metasurface can be extended to a large family of architected structures,
  thus opening new avenues for realistic metasurface designs that provide for nonlinear
  or amplitude-dependent wave tailoring.
