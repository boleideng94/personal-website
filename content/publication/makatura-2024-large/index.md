abstract: 'The progress in generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), opens new prospects in design and manufacturing. Our research explores the use of these tools throughout the entire design and manufacturing workflow. We assess the capabilities of LLMs in various tasks: converting text prompts into designs, generating design spaces and variations, transforming designs into manufacturing instructions, evaluating design performance, and searching for designs based on performance metrics. We identify and discuss the current strengths and limitations of LLMs, suggesting areas for potential enhancements. Additionally, we examine the ethical implications and propose strategies to mitigate risks associated with employing generative AI in design and manufacturing.'
