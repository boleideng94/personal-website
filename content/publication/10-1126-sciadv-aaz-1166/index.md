abstract: The unique properties of nonlinear waves have been recently exploited to
  enable a wide range of applications, including impact mitigation, asymmetric transmission,
  switching, and focusing. Here, we demonstrate that the propagation of nonlinear
  waves can be as well harnessed to make flexible structures crawl. By combining experimental
  and theoretical methods, we show that such pulse-driven locomotion reaches a maximum
  efficiency when the initiated pulses are solitons and that our simple machine can
  move on a wide range of surfaces and even steer. Our study expands the range of
  possible applications of nonlinear waves and demonstrates that they offer a new
  platform to make flexible machines to move.
