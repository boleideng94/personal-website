abstract: 'Exploratory robots play a crucial role in space, deep-sea, and rescue missions. However, their reliance on electronic sensors such as cameras, IMUs, and electronic skins makes them susceptible to extreme temperatures, high pressure, and electromagnetic interference. These vulnerabilities, coupled with the complexity and cost of electronics, limit the deployment of traditional systems. There is a need for alternative sensing methods that overcome these challenges.Inspired by biological organisms, physical intelligence offers a promising approach by integrating sensing, actuation, adaptation, and computation directly into a robot’s structure. This talk introduces a novel robotic system that senses the environment through its physical body. The system features a metamaterial-based structure, the Physical Network (PN), which is entirely passive yet highly resilient. When subjected to external forces, mechanical waves …'
