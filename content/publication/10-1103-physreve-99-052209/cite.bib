 abstract = {Nonlinear acoustic metamaterials offer the potential to enhance wave control opportunities beyond those already demonstrated via dispersion engineering in linear metamaterials. Managing the nonlinearities of a dynamic elastic system, however, remains a challenge, and the need now exists for new strategies to model and design these wave nonlinearities. Inspired by recent research on soft architected rotating-square structures, we propose herein a design for a nonlinear elastic metasurface with the capability to achieve nonlinear acoustic wave reflection control. The designed metasurface is composed of a single layer of rotating squares connected to thin and highly deformable ligaments placed between a rigid plate and a wall. It is shown that during the process of reflection at normal incidence, most of the incoming fundamental wave energy can be converted into the second harmonic wave. A conversion coefficient of approximately 0.8 towards the second harmonic is derived with a reflection coefficient of <0.05 at the incoming fundamental frequency. The theoretical results obtained using the harmonic balance method for a monochromatic pump source are confirmed by time-domain simulations for wave packets. The reported design of a nonlinear acoustic metasurface can be extended to a large family of architected structures, thus opening new avenues for realistic metasurface designs that provide for nonlinear or amplitude-dependent wave tailoring.},
