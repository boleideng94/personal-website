abstract: We demonstrate experimentally, numerically, and analytically that soft architected
  materials can support the propagation of elastic vector solitons. More specifically,
  we focus on structures comprising a network of squares connected by thin and highly
  deformable ligaments and investigate the propagation of planar nonlinear elastic
  waves. We find that for sufficiently large amplitudes two components—one translational
  and one rotational—are coupled together and copropagate without dispersion. Our
  results not only show that soft architected materials offer a new and rich platform
  to study the propagation of nonlinear waves, but also open avenues for the design
  of a new generation of smart systems that take advantage of nonlinearities to control
  and manipulate the propagation of large amplitude vibrations.
