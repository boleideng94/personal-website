abstract: 'Foldable mechanical metamaterials can toggle between multiple folding states with distinct properties. Each state differs in arrangement of elements and contact points, which change how mechanical signals and stresses distribute and propagate through the metastructure. Similarly, such folding states may influence how chemical signals travel, which may open new functional capabilities of these materials. Herein, we investigate how autocatalytic chemical waves propagate across passive metamaterial structures prepared from double network hydrogels with different geometry, hydrogel composition, and signalling chemistry. As folding states change, so do the signalling patterns; hinges and elements create new contact points that determine chemical signals’ pathways. Dynamically flipping between folding states allows for on-the-fly modulation of chemical signal propagation, including structure-aided transport, in both modelling and experiments. In such cases chemical signals hop across large distances aided by cycles of flipping through the folding states. Structuring chemical signal transport through foldable geometries, instead of propagation through the bulk, opens up unprecedented possibilities for user-defined control over spatiotemporal signal distribution in life-like materials.'
