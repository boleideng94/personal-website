abstract: A flexoelectric cantilever beam actuated by the converse flexoelectric effect
  is evaluated and its analytical and experimental data are compared in this study.
  A line-electrode on the top beam surface and a bottom surface electrode are used
  to generate an electric field gradient in the beam, so that internal stresses can
  be induced and applied to distributed actuations. Dynamic control effectiveness
  of the beam is investigated with a mathematical model and later validated by laboratory
  experiments. Analyses show that the actuation stress induced by the converse flexoelectric
  effect is in the longitudinal direction and results in a bending control moment
  to the flexoelectric beam since the stress in the thickness is inhomogeneous. It
  is found that thinner line-electrode radius and thinner flexoelectric beam lead
  to larger control effects on the beam. The position of the line-electrode on the
  top surface of the beam also influences the control effect. When the line electrode
  is close to the fixed end, it induces a larger tip displacement than that is close
  to the free end. Analytical results agree well with laboratory experimental data.
  This study of flexoelectric actuation and control provides a fundamental understanding
  of flexoelectric actuation mechanisms.
