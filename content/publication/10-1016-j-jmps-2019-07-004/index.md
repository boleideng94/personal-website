abstract: ' We propose an analytical framework to study the propagation of transition
  waves in one-dimensional free-standing lattices comprising concentrated masses and
  bistable springs. Starting from the discrete model, we derive the partial differential
  equation that describes the non-linear dynamic response of the system and obtain
  its exact closed-form solution. Such solution enables us to uncover the effect of
  the systemâ€™s parameters on the characteristics of the supported transition waves
  as well as to characterize the rarefaction front that precedes the pulse. As such,
  this work provides new opportunities to elucidate how transition waves propagate
  in systems in which the phase transition results in macroscopic volumetric changes.'
