abstract: 'Dispersion relations govern wave behaviors, and tailoring them is a grand challenge in wave manipulation. We demonstrate inverse design of phononic dispersion using non-local interactions on one-dimensional spring-mass chains. For both single-band and double-band cases, we can achieve any valid dispersion curves with analytical precision. We further employ our method to design phononic crystals with multiple ordinary (roton/maxon) and higher-order (undulation) critical points and investigate their wave packet dynamics.'
