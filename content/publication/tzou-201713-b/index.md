abstract: The converse flexoelectric effect, i.e., the polarization (or electric field)
  gradient-induced internal stress (or strain), can be utilized to actuate and control
  flexible structures. This study focuses on the microscopic actuation behavior and
  effectiveness of a flexoelectric actuator patch laminated on an elastic ring shell.
  An atomic force microscope (AFM) probe is placed on the upper surface of the flexoelectric
  patch to induce an inhomogeneous electric field resulting in internal stresses of
  the actuator patch. The flexoelectric stress-induced membrane control force and
  bending control moment regulate the ring vibration and their actuation mechanics,
  i.e., transverse and circumferential control actions, are, respectively, studied.
  For the transverse direction, the electric field gradient quickly decays along the
  ring thickness, resulting in a nonuniform transverse distribution of the induced
  stress, and this distribution profile is not influenced by the actuator thickness.
  The flexoelectric-induced circumferential membrane control force and bending control
  moment resemble the Dirac delta functions at the AFM contact point. The flexoelectric
  actuation can be regarded as a localized drastic bending to the ring. To evaluate
  the actuation effect, dynamic responses and controllable displacements of the elastic
  ring with flexoelectric actuations are analyzed with respect to design parameters,
  such as the flexoelectric patch thickness, AFM probe radius, ring thickness, and
  ring radius.
