abstract: 'We combine experimental, numerical, and analytical tools to design highly
  nonlinear mechanical metamaterials that exhibit a new phenomenon: gaps in amplitude
  for elastic vector solitons (i.e., ranges in amplitude where elastic soliton propagation
  is forbidden). Such gaps are fundamentally different from the spectral gaps in frequency
  typically observed in linear phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials and are
  induced by the lack of strong coupling between the two polarizations of the vector
  soliton. We show that the amplitude gaps are a robust feature of our system and
  that their width can be controlled both by varying the structural properties of
  the units and by breaking the symmetry in the underlying geometry. Moreover, we
  demonstrate that amplitude gaps provide new opportunities to manipulate highly nonlinear
  elastic pulses, as demonstrated by the designed soliton splitters and diodes. Here,
  the authors experimentally observed, numerically simulate, and mathematically analyze
  the existence of amplitude gaps for elastic vector solitons in highly deformable
  mechanical metamaterials consisting of rigid units and elastic hinges.'
