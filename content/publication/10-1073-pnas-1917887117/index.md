abstract: Transition waves that sequentially switch bistable elements from one stable
  configuration to another have received significant interest in recent years not
  only because of their rich physics but also, for their potential applications, including
  unidirectional propagation, energy harvesting, and mechanical computation. Here,
  we exploit the propagation of transition waves in a bistable one-dimensional (1D)
  linkage as a robust mechanism to realize structures that can be quickly deployed.
  We first use a combination of experiments and analyses to show that, if the bistable
  joints are properly designed, transition waves can propagate throughout the entire
  structure and transform the initial straight configuration into a curved one. We
  then demonstrate that such bistable linkages can be used as building blocks to realize
  deployable three-dimensional (3D) structures of arbitrary shape.
