abstract: Multi-welled energy landscapes arising in shells with nonzero Gaussian curvature
  typically fade away as their thickness becomes larger because of the increased bending
  energy required for inversion. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a strategy
  to realize doubly curved shells that are bistable for any thickness. We then study
  the nonlinear dynamic response of one-dimensional (1D) arrays of our universally
  bistable shells when coupled by compressible fluid cavities. We find that the system
  supports the propagation of bidirectional transition waves whose characteristics
  can be tuned by varying both geometric parameters as well as the amount of energy
  supplied to initiate the waves. However, since our bistable shells have equal energy
  minima, the distance traveled by such waves is limited by dissipation. To overcome
  this limitation, we identify a strategy to realize thick bistable shells with tunable
  energy landscape and show that their strategic placement within the 1D array can
  extend the propagation distance of the supported bidirectional transition waves.
  Curved elastic shells have unique mechanical behavior and multiple stable configurations,
  but these properties fade when the shell thickness increases. Here the authors report
  a strategy to realize bistable doubly curved shells with arbitrary thickness, and
  how to optimize the dynamic response of one-dimensional connected arrays of such
  doubly-curved bistable shells.
