abstract: 'In article number 2001863, Katia Bertoldi and co‐workers fabricate the
  first programmable kirigami balloons: soft devices that can be automatically designed
  to morph into a target shape upon inflation. This work provides a new platform for
  shape‐morphing devices that could support the design of innovative medical tools,
  actuators, and reconfigurable structures. Cover art: Antonio Elia Forte.'
