abstract: Domain walls, commonly occurring at the interface of different phases in
  solid-state materials, have recently been harnessed at the structural scale to enable
  additional modes of functionality. Here, we combine experimental, numerical, and
  theoretical tools to investigate the domain walls emerging upon uniaxial compression
  in a mechanical metamaterial based on the rotating-squares mechanism. We first show
  that these interfaces can be generated and controlled by carefully arranging a few
  phase-inducing defects. We establish an analytical model to capture the evolution
  of the domain walls as a function of the applied deformation. We then employ this
  model as a guideline to realize interfaces of complex shape. Finally, we show that
  the engineered domain walls modify the global response of the metamaterial and can
  be effectively exploited to tune its stiffness as well as to guide the propagation
  of elastic waves.
