abstract: 'We investigate via a combination of experiments and numerical analyses
  the collision of elastic vector solitons in a chain of rigid units connected by
  flexible hinges. Because of the vectorial nature of these solitons, very unusual
  behaviors are observed: while, as expected, the solitons emerge unaltered from the
  collision if they excite rotations of the same direction, they do not penetrate
  each other and instead repel one another if they induce rotations of the opposite
  direction. Our analysis reveals that such anomalous collisions are a consequence
  of the large-amplitude characteristics of the solitons, which locally modify the
  properties of the underlying media. Specifically, their large rotations create a
  significant barrier for pulses that excite rotations of the opposite direction and
  this may block their propagation. Our findings provide new insights into the collision
  dynamics of elastic solitary waves. Furthermore, the observed anomalous collisions
  pave new ways towards the advanced control of large amplitude mechanical pulses,
  as they provide opportunities to remotely detect, change, or destruct high-amplitude
  signals and impacts.'
