 abstract = {In article number 2001863, Katia Bertoldi and co‐workers fabricate the first programmable kirigami balloons: soft devices that can be automatically designed to morph into a target shape upon inflation. This work provides a new platform for shape‐morphing devices that could support the design of innovative medical tools, actuators, and reconfigurable structures. Cover art: Antonio Elia Forte.},
