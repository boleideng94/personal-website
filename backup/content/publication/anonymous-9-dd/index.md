abstract: Kirigami-inspired metamaterials are attracting increasing interest because
  of their ability to achieve extremely large strains and shape changes via out-of-plane
  buckling. While in flat kirigami sheets, the ligaments buckle simultaneously as
  Euler columns, leading to a continuous phase transition; here, we demonstrate that
  kirigami shells can also support discontinuous phase transitions. Specifically,
  we show via a combination of experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical
  analysis that, in cylindrical kirigami shells, the snapping-induced curvature inversion
  of the initially bent ligaments results in a pop-up process that first localizes
  near an imperfection and then, as the deformation is increased, progressively spreads
  through the structure. Notably, we find that the width of the transition zone as
  well as the stress at which propagation of the instability is triggered can be controlled
  by carefully selecting the geometry of the cuts and the curvature of the shell.
  Our study significantly expands the ability of existing kirigami metamaterials and
  opens avenues for the design of the next generation of responsive surfaces as demonstrated
  by the design of a smart skin that significantly enhances the crawling efficiency
  of a simple linear actuator.
