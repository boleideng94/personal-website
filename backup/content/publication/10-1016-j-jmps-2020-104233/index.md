abstract: Flexible mechanical metamaterials have been recently shown to support a
  rich nonlinear dynamic response. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the
  behavior of rotating-square architected systems in the continuum limit can be described
  by nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations. Here, we report on a general class of solutions
  of these nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations, namely cnoidal waves based on the Jacobi
  elliptic functions sn, cn and dn. By analyzing theoretically and numerically their
  validity and stability in the design- and wave-parameter space, we show that these
  cnoidal wave solutions extend from linear waves (or phonons) to solitons, while
  covering also a wide family of nonlinear periodic waves. The presented results thus
  reunite under the same framework different concepts of linear and non-linear waves
  and offer a fertile ground for extending the range of possible control strategies
  for nonlinear elastic waves and vibrations.
