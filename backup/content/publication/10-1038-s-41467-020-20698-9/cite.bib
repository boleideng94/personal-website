 abstract = {Multi-welled energy landscapes arising in shells with nonzero Gaussian curvature typically fade away as their thickness becomes larger because of the increased bending energy required for inversion. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a strategy to realize doubly curved shells that are bistable for any thickness. We then study the nonlinear dynamic response of one-dimensional (1D) arrays of our universally bistable shells when coupled by compressible fluid cavities. We find that the system supports the propagation of bidirectional transition waves whose characteristics can be tuned by varying both geometric parameters as well as the amount of energy supplied to initiate the waves. However, since our bistable shells have equal energy minima, the distance traveled by such waves is limited by dissipation. To overcome this limitation, we identify a strategy to realize thick bistable shells with tunable energy landscape and show that their strategic placement within the 1D array can extend the propagation distance of the supported bidirectional transition waves. Curved elastic shells have unique mechanical behavior and multiple stable configurations, but these properties fade when the shell thickness increases. Here the authors report a strategy to realize bistable doubly curved shells with arbitrary thickness, and how to optimize the dynamic response of one-dimensional connected arrays of such doubly-curved bistable shells.},
