abstract: We investigate the effects of large predeformation on the propagation of
  planar solitary waves in flexible mechanical metamaterials comprising an array of
  hinged rotating squares. The predictive framework of our theoretical analysis shows
  that the predeformation can be exploited to control the characteristics of the supported
  elastic vector solitons via the tuning of the metamaterial dispersive and nonlinear
  properties. Together with numerical tests, our study provides a better understanding
  of the tunable dynamic response of flexible nonlinear mechanical metamaterials and
  explores more advanced configurations and effects that could open avenues for the
  design of systems with enhanced tunability.
