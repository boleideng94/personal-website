abstract = {{Multi-welled energy landscapes arising in shells with nonzero Gaussian curvature typically fade away as their thickness becomes larger because of the increased bending energy required for inversion. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a strategy to realize doubly curved shells that are bistable for any thickness. We then study the nonlinear dynamic response of one-dimensional (1D) arrays of our universally bistable shells when coupled by compressible fluid cavities. We find that the system supports the propagation of bidirectional transition waves whose characteristics can be tuned by varying both geometric parameters as well as the amount of energy supplied to initiate the waves. However, since our bistable shells have equal energy minima, the distance traveled by such waves is limited by dissipation. To overcome this limitation, we identify a strategy to realize thick bistable shells with tunable energy landscape and show that their strategic placement within the 1D array can extend the propagation distance of the supported bidirectional transition waves. Curved elastic shells have unique mechanical behavior and multiple stable configurations, but these properties fade when the shell thickness increases. Here the authors report a strategy to realize bistable doubly curved shells with arbitrary thickness, and how to optimize the dynamic response of one-dimensional connected arrays of such doubly-curved bistable shells.}},

Managing the nonlinearities of a dynamic elastic system, however, remains a challenge, and the need now exists for new strategies to model and design these wave nonlinearities. Inspired by recent research on soft architected rotating-square structures, we propose herein a design for a nonlinear elastic metasurface with the capability to achieve nonlinear acoustic wave reflection control. The designed metasurface is composed of a single layer of rotating squares connected to thin and highly deformable ligaments placed between a rigid plate and a wall. It is shown that during the process of reflection at normal incidence, most of the incoming fundamental wave energy can be converted into the second harmonic wave. A conversion coefficient of approximately 0.8 towards the second harmonic is derived with a reflection coefficient of <0.05 at the incoming fundamental frequency. The theoretical results obtained using the harmonic balance method for a monochromatic pump source are confirmed by time-domain simulations for wave packets. The reported design of a nonlinear acoustic metasurface can be extended to a large family of architected structures, thus opening new avenues for realistic metasurface designs that provide for nonlinear or amplitude-dependent wave tailoring.}},

While in flat kirigami sheets, the ligaments buckle simultaneously as Euler columns, leading to a continuous phase transition; here, we demonstrate that kirigami shells can also support discontinuous phase transitions. Specifically, we show via a combination of experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis that, in cylindrical kirigami shells, the snapping-induced curvature inversion of the initially bent ligaments results in a pop-up process that first localizes near an imperfection and then, as the deformation is increased, progressively spreads through the structure. Notably, we find that the width of the transition zone as well as the stress at which propagation of the instability is triggered can be controlled by carefully selecting the geometry of the cuts and the curvature of the shell. Our study significantly expands the ability of existing kirigami metamaterials and opens avenues for the design of the next generation of responsive surfaces as demonstrated by the design of a smart skin that significantly enhances the crawling efficiency of a simple linear actuator.}},

This study focuses on the microscopic actuation behavior and effectiveness of a flexoelectric actuator patch laminated on an elastic ring shell. An atomic force microscope (AFM) probe is placed on the upper surface of the flexoelectric patch to induce an inhomogeneous electric field resulting in internal stresses of the actuator patch. The flexoelectric stress-induced membrane control force and bending control moment regulate the ring vibration and their actuation mechanics, i.e., transverse and circumferential control actions, are, respectively, studied. For the transverse direction, the electric field gradient quickly decays along the ring thickness, resulting in a nonuniform transverse distribution of the induced stress, and this distribution profile is not influenced by the actuator thickness. The flexoelectric-induced circumferential membrane control force and bending control moment resemble the Dirac delta functions at the AFM contact point. The flexoelectric actuation can be regarded as a localized drastic bending to the ring. To evaluate the actuation effect, dynamic responses and controllable displacements of the elastic ring with flexoelectric actuations are analyzed with respect to design parameters, such as the flexoelectric patch thickness, AFM probe radius, ring thickness, and ring radius.}},

A line-electrode on the top beam surface and a bottom surface electrode are used to generate an electric field gradient in the beam, so that internal stresses can be induced and applied to distributed actuations. Dynamic control effectiveness of the beam is investigated with a mathematical model and later validated by laboratory experiments. Analyses show that the actuation stress induced by the converse flexoelectric effect is in the longitudinal direction and results in a bending control moment to the flexoelectric beam since the stress in the thickness is inhomogeneous. It is found that thinner line-electrode radius and thinner flexoelectric beam lead to larger control effects on the beam. The position of the line-electrode on the top surface of the beam also influences the control effect. When the line electrode is close to the fixed end, it induces a larger tip displacement than that is close to the free end. Analytical results agree well with laboratory experimental data.

abstract = {{Inhomogeneous electric field induces internal stress in flexoelectric materials, which is known as the converse flexoelectric effect. The atomic force microscope (AFM) probe can be applied to actuate the flexoelectric patch laminated on flexible structures and, in turn, induce structural vibrations. In this study, multiple actuators (i.e., combination of multiple AFM probes and flexoelectric patches) are used to suppress the vibration of an elastic cantilever beam. The displacement of the beam under control is obtained by superposition of a mechanical force induced part and an actuator induced part. The optimal actuator positions are selected when the minimal tip displacement of the cantilever beam is achieved. In case studies, only three actuators are used and only first three beam modes are considered. Under resonance conditions where only one mode participates, the optimal positions are obtained and they only depend on the relationship between actuation factor and actuator’s position. The influence of the patch length is discussed, followed by the analysis of control voltages applied to actuators. When the control voltage is so small as to the induced displacement is far less than that induced by the mechanical force, the optimal actuation positions do not vary with the voltage magnitude; while when the voltage is relatively large the actuators keep adjusting their relative optimal positions with respect to the control voltage and the system becomes unstable. Furthermore, as long as the control voltage is relatively small below the stability threshold, the optimal positions do not change as the position where mechanical force placed along the beam. Under the small voltage condition, a smooth relationship between optimal positions and vibration frequency is obtained. There are four jump points of optimal positions and they are related to the tip displacement-actuator position curves under different frequencies. This study serves as the foundation of flexoelectric vibration control with multiple AFM/flexoelectric actuators on flexible structures.Copyright © 2015 by ASME}},

Our analysis reveals that such anomalous collisions are a consequence of the large-amplitude characteristics of the solitons, which locally modify the properties of the underlying media. Specifically, their large rotations create a significant barrier for pulses that excite rotations of the opposite direction and this may block their propagation. Our findings provide new insights into the collision dynamics of elastic solitary waves. Furthermore, the observed anomalous collisions pave new ways towards the advanced control of large amplitude mechanical pulses, as they provide opportunities to remotely detect, change, or destruct high-amplitude signals and impacts.}},
